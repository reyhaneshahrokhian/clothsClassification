# Cloths classification

* ### The Fashion MNIST dataset
   + Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The mapping of all 0-9 integers to class labels is listed below:
   
   + ● 0: T-shirt/top
   + ● 1: Trouser
   + ● 2: Pullover
   + ● 3: Dress
   + ● 4: Coat
   + ● 5: Sandal
   + ● 6: Shirt
   + ● 7: Sneaker
   + ● 8: Bag
   + ● 9: Ankle boot

* ### This project:
   + In this mini project I have done a cloths classification task using Fashion MNIST dataset with implementing a MLP Network with only one hidden layer but trying 4 different hidden units count. As it is clear from the reports, as number of hidden units increased, we get better inference.
